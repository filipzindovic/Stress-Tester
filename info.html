            <h1>STRESS TESTER</h1>
            <p>This quirky application has been adapted from the famous dot-probe task. First developed by Macleod, Mathews and Tata (1986), the dot probe task aims to assess the degree to which an individual's attention is captured and held by different types of stimuli. Research has shown that in a social setting, attention can be both consciously and unconsciously directed at positive and negative social cues. <br> <br> The real trials of the 'Stress Tester' simultaneously shows a threatening social cue (angry or sad face) alongside a non-threatening social cue (happy or neutral face). The speed with which an individual is able to identify the arrow that replaces the threatening stimuli (compared to non-threatening) indicates the degree to which your attention was automatically drawn toward the threatening social stimulus during the short moment the pictures were displayed. Thus, if you consistently identified the arrow faster when it replaced the threatening stimulus, this would indicate an attentional bias toward negative social stimuli. Indeed the research of Dandeneau and colleagues (2007) has demonstrated that stressed participants are more likely to be attuned to negative social stimuli than their non-stressed counterparts. <br><br>From the moment of birth, social contact with others becomes a basic psychological need just as water, sleep and food are a physiological need. As we grow older our mental habits begin to strongly influence the way we experience this social world. One's self-esteem, deep-rooted values, current mood and expectations of others are all part of these mental habits. Therefore if on a certain day you are not feeling in a good mood or you are worrying about your goals/deadlines/appearance, you may interpret ambiguous social interactions in a negative way and find yourself focussing on your flaws and looking out for social threats such as criticism. Conversely a positive attentional bias will lead you to interpret unclear interactions in a positive manner thus you might focus on your strengths rather than weaknesses.
